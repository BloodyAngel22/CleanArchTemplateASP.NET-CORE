# CleanArchTemplateASP.NET-CORE

Made my own template to quickly create an ASP.NET Core application with a clean architecture. I don't have much experience in pure architecture. I did it mainly for myself. I will make edits if possible.

To install the package (In Template directory):
```bash
dotnet new install ./
```

To overwrite an existing package(In Template directory):
```bash
dotnet new install --force ./
```

To create a new project:
```bash
dotnet new cleanarch -n "YourProjectName"
```
